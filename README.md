# Image-Enhancer

Static in-browser webpage that converts any uploaded image into Obama by resizing a template image to match the input (no AI, no backend).

## How to use

1. Open `index.html` in a browser (you can double-click it).
2. Upload any image under **Input image** (only used to pick output size).
3. Upload your Obama template image under **Obama template** (this becomes the output).
   - Optional (when hosted): add `assets/obama-template.webp` and it will auto-load.
4. Click **Just Obama** and optionally **Download PNG**.

## Notes

- Everything runs locally in your browser; images are not uploaded anywhere.
- Output size is capped for speed.

## GitHub Pages

On GitHub: Repo Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → `main` / `/ (root)`.
